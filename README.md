## Design

### Design Choices
The design of the website is simplistic, its easy to find everything and not to many menues to get lost in. 
I originally had an ide for more content and visuals on the side, but after some thought i felt it was a bit to cluttery.

### Color
The color scheme is very simple, with mostly black and white colors. I made it this way beacouse the company logo was black and white, and i thought it looked clean for everything else to follow in that line.
<br>


### Fonts
I used Montserrat for all fonts and sans-serif as a fallback becouse i think Montserrat makes everything looks really good.


### Structure
With the minimalistic design its easy to feel at home. You quickly find your way around with
a recogniseble interface.
The website consists of five separate pages: 
- A homepage with the logo of the company
- A about page that show some information about the company
- A roster page that shows the companys artists
- A page for each of the artists that contains information, previews their music and links 
  to their socials. 
- A contact page with mail, location and a form to submit your music.
